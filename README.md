Analysis of speed-dating data

The data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/speed-dating, which in turn is derived from http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating/. A series of 21 speed-dating events were held in 2002-2004, and data was collected about participants before and during the event. The dataset includes information about participants' age, gender, race, attributes, priorities, interests, and reactions to one another.

This is a small project undertaken for the purpose of practice. Comments and critique are very welcome!

Includes:
* Data preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Feature selection
* Pipelines
* Machine learning
* Explainable AI methods, permutation importance and partial dependence plots
* Using data visualisations to draw and explain conclusions
